# RaspAP Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

RaspAP is an open source community project devoted to building simple yet 
powerful wireless router software for Debian-based devices. We as members, contributors,
and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone.

To this end, we pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being excellent to one another (treat others as you wish to be treated)
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

We will not tolerate harassment. Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior
towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive
verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, deliberate intimidation,
bullying, stalking, sustained disruption of discussion or events, or nonconsensual
publication of private comments.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

We reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues,
discussions and other contributions that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct.
We may ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for violating this code, as appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
